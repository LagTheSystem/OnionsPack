# OnionsPack
This repo serves as a simple layout that you can use to start your resource pack for [Onion's Life](https://onions.life)

## Creating a Pack
To create your pack:
1. Fork this repo
2. Make your desired changes
3. Copy the link to the main folder in this format: https://github.com/*username*/OnionsPack/main/OnionsPack
  - Make sure the link does **NOT** include a /tree/ directory, this will make the pack not work for some strange GitHub reason I don't understand
5. Paste the link into [Githack](https://raw.githack.com)
6. Copy the link from "Use this URL in production"
7. Press "U" on the home screen of [Onion's Life](https://onions.life)
